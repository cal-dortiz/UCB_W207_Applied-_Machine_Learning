## Description

### About
This repo contains Ortiz and Weitz's housing price predictive model built off of the [Anmes Housing Data](http://jse.amstat.org/v19n3/decock.pdf) compiled by compiled by Dean De Cock. Data was sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/).

### Goal
Develope a model that predicts the housing price for each individual I.D. in the Test Data

### Key Performance Indicator
Model performance will be deteremend by Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) between the logarithm of the predicted value and the logarithm of the observed sales price.
